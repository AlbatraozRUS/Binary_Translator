# Binary_Translator
This is final project of ASM`s course, which is continuation of my language from 1_sem. It translates from jail language to ASM x86-64 and allows us to create simple programs like square_solver or factorial. One of features is little optimizer, which, for example, accelerated a hundred million iteration run of the factorial program by about nine percent. Hope yo will have fun  in writing code on it.
